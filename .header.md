## Introduction

[Pachyderm](https://www.pachyderm.com) is an open-source-driven solution that provides data lineage and pipelines. Data lineage is important for _provenance_; knowing the origin of downstream assets. In ML, the assets are often models and the provenance describes how the model became to be. Precise knowledge of what a model was trained upon is important for disaster recovery, auditing, and robustness.

Pipelines encode a process. This can be anything from automating pre-processing, to training and deploying models. Pachyderm's solution is unique beacuse it is backed by data lineage; i.e. data driven pipelines, not process driven ones.

## Test Drive

The fastest way to get started is to use the test drive functionality provided by [TestFaster](https://testfaster.ci). Click on the "Launch Test Drive" button below (opens a new window).

### Quick Start Pachyderm Tutorial

Once the test drive has launched, click the two links to the left to get started with Pachyderm:

1. Click the Jupyter link and launch the `demo.ipynb` notebook.
2. Click on the Dashboard link to launch the Pachyderm Enterprise Dashboard.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Start by preparing your Kubernetes cluster using one of the [infrastructure components](https://combinator.ml/infrastructure/introduction/) or use your own cluster.

### Component Usage

```terraform
module "pachyderm" {
  source  = "combinator-ml/pachyderm/k8s"
  # Optional settings go here
}
```

See the full configuration options below.
